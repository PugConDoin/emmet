    <h2>Project Workflow for Smaller Projects and Static Websites</h2>
    <p>
      This workflow uses a Live Server extension to serve the current project in
      the browser. Changes to projects files are served in real time in the
      browser. 'Index.html' is located within the project's 'dist' folder. Sass
      is written into 'main.scss', contained within the 'scss' folder. A Sass
      Compiler compiles Sass into 'main.min.css' file within dist--css.
      JavaScript is written in a main.js file saved in dist--js folder.
